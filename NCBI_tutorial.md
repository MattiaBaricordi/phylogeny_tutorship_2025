# Beginner's Guide to Using NCBI for Genes and Genomes

## Accessing NCBI

Go to the NCBI website: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

Use the search bar at the top and the dropdown menu for different databases.

## Searching for Mitochondrial Data

Keywords: "mito", "mitochondrial", "mitochondrion"

"mito": useful for broader searches.

"mitochondrial" or "mitochondrion": useful for more specific results.

Using AND/OR Queries

AND: To find results containing all keywords.

Example: "mitochondrial AND human".

OR: To find results containing any of the keywords.

Example: "mito OR mitochondrial".

Combine them for complex searches:

Example: "mito AND human OR mouse".

Example Search Steps

In the NCBI search bar, type: "mito AND Homo sapiens" and select "Organelles".

Review the results for mitochondria-related entries.

Try variations:

"mitochondrial OR mitochondrion Homo sapiens".

"mito AND mitochondrial Homo sapiens".

Compare results to understand the specificity of each keyword.

## Using the Organelles Database

Contains genome sequences of organelles like mitochondria.

How to Use It

From the dropdown, select "Organelles".

Enter a search like "mitochondrial AND mouse".

Click on relevant results to access sequences.

## Using the Taxonomy Database

What is It? 
Contains classification information for organisms.

How to Search
Select "Taxonomy" from the dropdown.

Use keywords: "mito AND Genus species" or "mitochondrial OR mitochondrion Genus species".

Review lineage and related information.

## Retrieving Genetic Sequences

Step-by-Step

Click on a search result.

Use "FASTA" or "GenBank" links to view sequences.

Download using "Send to" > "File" > "FASTA" > "Create File".

## Tips for Effective Searching

Use quotes for exact matches: "mitochondrial genome".

Use AND/OR for complex searches.

Explore links on result pages.
