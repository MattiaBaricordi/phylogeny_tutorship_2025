# Installing IQ-TREE Using Conda on Linux

## Understanding Conda Environments
Conda environments are isolated spaces where you can install specific software and dependencies without interfering with the systemâ€™s default packages.   
They help manage software dependencies efficiently, making it easier to work on multiple projects with different package requirements.  

Each environment acts as a self-contained workspace where you can:  
- Install software without affecting other applications.  
- Use different versions of the same package for different projects.  
- Easily share and reproduce computational workflows.  

## 1. Installing Conda (If Not Already Installed)  
Before installing IQ-TREE, ensure you have Conda installed. To check:  
```bash
conda --version
```
If Conda is installed, you should see an output like:  
```
conda 23.1.0
```
If not installed, refer to the [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  

## 2. Creating a Conda Environment  
To avoid conflicts with system-wide packages, it is recommended to create a new Conda environment for IQ-TREE:  
```bash
conda create -n phylo_env 
```
Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate phylo_env
```

## 3. Installing IQ-TREE
Once inside the Conda environment, install IQ-TREE from the **bioconda** channel:
```bash
conda install -c bioconda iqtree -y
```

## 4. Verifying the Installation
After installation, verify that IQ-TREE is installed
```bash
#open the manual
iqtree -h
iqtree --help
#check the path
which iqtree
```
If the installation is successful, you should see the IQ-TREE help menu.
Alternatively, check the installed version with:
```bash
iqtree --version
```

## 5. Updating or Removing IQ-TREE
To update IQ-TREE:
```bash
conda update -c bioconda iqtree -y
```

## 6. Deactivating the Conda Environment
After using IQ-TREE, deactivate the Conda environment:
```bash
conda deactivate
```
To completely remove the environment:
```bash
conda env remove -n phylo_env
```
